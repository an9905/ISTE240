<p>Hello my name is Adrian, I am currently a third year in Computer Security doing Web & Mobile as my minor, hence this ISTE240 Fall Semester course.
I am from Albania, a small country that borders Greece in the Balkans. I was born here though, in Bronx NY. My birthday is actually the day before Halloween on October 30th.
I also love to play basketball, and design websites. I actually took Web & Mobile I in my first semester of college at RIT, when I was
still in the computer exploration. It did interest me as much as Cyber Security, however I decided I would just minor in it eventually.
So far I have only worked part time jobs over the summer not related to my major, so I am actually seeking a co-op in the computer field in general.
